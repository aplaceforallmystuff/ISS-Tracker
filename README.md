# ISS Live Tracker üõ∞Ô∏è

A real-time International Space Station (ISS) tracker with live Earth views from space. Track the ISS position, watch live footage from onboard cameras, and find out when you can see it from your location.

## About
This is a fun vibe-coded project with Claude Opus 4. After stargazing with my kids one night, I wanted them to be able to see where the ISS was as well as a live video feed on one device without having a satellite tracking app in one hand and a device with YouTube in the other.
